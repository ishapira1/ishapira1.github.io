    <p class="research-description">    Generative social choice is a novel research paradigm that merges traditional social choice theory with the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for generating text and predicting preferences. The proposed framework is twofold: it first ensures that AI-supported democratic processes meet stringent representation standards using idealized oracle queries and then validates these queries using actual LLMs. This approach is demonstrated by designing a method to curate representative opinion statements from online user interactions. Essentially, generative social choice aims to enhance democratic decision-making by leveraging LLMs to produce diverse and representative alternatives that were not previously considered.
