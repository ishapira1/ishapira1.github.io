I'm a CS graduate student at Harvard University, supported by the Nicole A. Chen and Karina A. Chen Graduate Student Research Fellowship. I am privileged to be advised by Prof. Ariel D. Procaccia.
Before joining Harvard, I worked for 4 years as a Quant for WorldQuant (under Millennium), where my main focus was alpha research in equity markets. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate degree in Math and Economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI), graduating as valedictorian. I was fortunate to work with Prof. Jeff Rosenschein and Prof. Assaf Romm during my time at HUJI.
