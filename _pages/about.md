<p>
I'm a CS graduate student at Harvard University, supported by the Nicole A. Chen and Karina A. Chen Graduate Student Research Fellowship. I am privileged to be advised by <a href="http://procaccia.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Ariel D. Procaccia</a>.
</p>
<p>
Before joining Harvard, I worked for 4 years as a Quant for <a href="https://www.worldquant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WorldQuant</a> (under <a href="https://www.mlp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Millennium</a>), where my main focus was alpha research in equity markets. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate degree in Math and Economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI), graduating as valedictorian. I was fortunate to work with <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~jeff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Jeff Rosenschein</a> and <a href="http://assafromm.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Assaf Romm</a> during my time at HUJI.
