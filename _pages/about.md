<p>
  I'm a CS PhD student at Harvard University. I am privileged to be advised by <a href="http://procaccia.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Ariel D. Procaccia</a>.<br>
  I'm interested in AI safety, computational social choice, optimization, and everything in between. I’m now mainly thinking about preference-based post-training for aligning and evaluating AI systems. <br> 

  I am a recipient of the 2025 JPMorgan Chase PhD Fellowship, and I was also supported by the Nicole A. Chen and Karina A. Chen Graduate Student Research Fellowship. I am affiliated with the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/ai-sdm/students/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NSF AI Institute for Societal Decision Making</a> and serve on its Student Leadership Council. Before my PhD I worked as a senior quantitative researcher at WorldQuant (Millennium) and interned in 2025 as a quant at Two Sigma on online learning optimization.
